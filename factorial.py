# Write a program that asks a user for a postive integer and then prints out the 
# factorial of that number. The factorial of a number k is:
#
# 		k! = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
#
# You should get input from the user using the input function. It's ok if your
# program crashes or does something strange if the user inputs something that
# is not a positive integer.
